## Implementation Details

### Features Implemented

✅ **Pure CSS Animation**: Uses `@keyframes` for infinite horizontal scrolling
✅ **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
✅ **Accessibility**:

- Proper ARIA labels
- Pause animation on hover
- Screen reader friendly
  ✅ **Dark Theme Support**: Automatic theme switching
  ✅ **Performance**:
- CSS-only animation (no JavaScript)
- Uses `transform: translateX()` for GPU acceleration
  ✅ **Seamless Loop**: Duplicates logos for continuous scrolling
  ✅ **Interactive**: Hover effects with scaling and opacity changes

### Technical Approach

- **Animation Technique**: Duplicates the logo set and uses CSS `translateX(-50%)` to create seamless infinite scroll
- **Browser Compatibility**: Added `-webkit-` prefixes for mask properties
- **Styling**: Copied and adapted existing logo styles from landing page
- **Theming**: Uses CSS custom properties for theme-aware gradients

### Animation Details

- **Duration**: 40 seconds for full cycle
- **Direction**: Left to right horizontal scroll
- **Easing**: Linear for consistent speed
- **Interaction**: Pauses on hover for accessibility

### CSS Features

- Gradient fade masks on left/right edges for smooth visual effect
- Responsive logo sizing (3rem height on desktop, scales down on mobile)
- Hover effects with 1.05x scale and opacity fade
- Proper mask image handling for SVG logos

## Integration

The component is integrated into the landing page replacing the previous static 4-column logo grid. The "As seen in" text remains above the carousel.

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS mask support
- Fallback styles for older browsers
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Usage

```html
<gf-logo-carousel></gf-logo-carousel>
```

The component is self-contained and requires no additional configuration.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on different screen sizes
2. Verify smooth animation performance
3. Check accessibility with screen readers
4. Test dark/light theme switching
5. Verify all logo links work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build application: `npm run build:production`
3. Test in browser: `npm run start:client`
4. View in Storybook: `npm run start:storybook`

The implementation follows the exact requirements from issue #5660:

- ✅ Standalone Angular component at `@ghostfolio/ui/logo-carousel`
- ✅ Pure CSS infinite scrolling animation
- ✅ Integrated into landing page replacing static logos
